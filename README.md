# Ticket-management-system

This is a simulation of a ticket management system for a hypothetical theater. It was an assignment for the course "Operating Systems" of AUEB's Informatics Department, and the main purpose of the project was to learn about multithreading in C and about the use of mutexes and condition variables to lock resources and wait for other threads.

My partners for this project were Vasilis Ballas([@BLM3826](https://github.com/BLM3826)) and Thanos Makris([@makristhanos](https://github.com/makristhanos)).
